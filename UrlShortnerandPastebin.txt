Url shortner : ( Similar approach can be useed for pastebin)

Questions :
what is the length if url : 7 character
what is the volume of traffic
is the system is single instance or should we scale it ?

API : 
CreatetinyURL
getLong


Persistance Layer
Data Capacity Mode :
Longurl 2048bytes
short url : 
created at :
expiratred at 

Logic to generate 7 character url :
base62 : this gives 62 ^7 combination

approach 1 : 
Get a random 7 charater long sequnce from [a-z,A-Z,0-9]
''.join(random.choice(string.ascii.uppercase + string.ascii.lowercase + string.digits) for _ in range(7))
problem : We could get a same random number , in this case we have to check the db if this is already present if so then we repeate the process. 
This works for single host app server , but in case of multi host this may not works as the other worker node may be inserting the same in the database

Approach2 : 
Apply md5 function on the long url and and get the result in binary and the take first 43 bit and apply base62. This still have collision but it may save some space in case of two users wants to generate the tiny url for same longurl

Best Approach :
use zookeper and counter base approach. 
The zookeeepr maintains a counter in memory
when a node get a request to create a tiny url it contacts zookeeper and get the counter value. The node then apply base62 and generate tiny url
The problem with this approach is if zookeeper is single point of failure.

We can use range based approach
we devide the 3.5 trillion combination in range for ech billion :
1 - 1m
1m - 2m
2m - 3m

1) Load balancer redirect the trffic to different node
2) All nodes are connected to zookeeper
3) zookeeper maintains a range of counter in memory 
4) Application node register iteself to zookeeper and zookeeper provide a range to host and mark that as used
5)App node use that range and pass that to base62 liberary and generate tiny url
